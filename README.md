# SWOT Analysis Generator

This project is a simple web application that generates a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis based on user input. The application uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate the analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js:** [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
